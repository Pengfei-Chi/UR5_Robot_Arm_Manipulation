# UR5_Robot_Arm_Manipulation
The objective of this project is to use the UR5 robot to perform the classic pick-and-place operation automatically. I implement a program that allows you to ﬁrst “teach” the UR5 the position of the start and target locations and then automatically complete the pick-and-place operation using a gripper and several diﬀerent types of control.

Details of this project has been post to my website: https://tianyusong.com/2017/12/11/ur5-robot-arm-manipulation/
